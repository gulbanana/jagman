# Jujutsu AGent MANager

JAGMAN is an experimental dashboard for TUI coding agents, using Jujutsu workspaces anonymous branches to coordinate work. JAGMAN aims to solve an MxNxO problem: multiple agents of multiple kinds running in multiple repositories. At this scale, users' attention is the bottleneck; we want to reduce the overhead of agent management by bringing information together and focusing attention on the few things that actually matter.

"Experimental" undersells it: JAGMAN is not ready for use. Feel free to look at the code, but don't bother trying to run it yet.
